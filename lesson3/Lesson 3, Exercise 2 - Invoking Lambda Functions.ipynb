However, you'll practice a different way to launch asynchronous invocation, and also practice the setup of an asynchronous invocation.\n",

The example we're asking you to implement is a CLI invocation, but Lambda functions can also be placed behind Amazon's API Gateway for potential users to directly invoke a Lambda function. This, in turn, could be the interface that you expose to users to allow them to interact with other AWS resources. These types of invocations are great for \"get\" and \"set\" methods."
